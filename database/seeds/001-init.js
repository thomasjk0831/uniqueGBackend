        "Take a break in the middle of a hard-core study session or a draining evening of presentation planning with these three challenging puzzles. Start with the cross- and star-shaped brainteasers to get your neurons firing, then move on to the hardest one in the set: the snake cube. Taking them apart is easy; putting them back together is where your problem-solving skills get their time to shine. All three come in a glass-top wooden box for display and storage—that is, if you can ever put them down. Hand-carved from rosewood in India.",

If you're into outer space, you'll not only appreciate that this puzzle is based on a photo from the Hubble Space Telescope that shows stars being born in the Carina nebula, but also, much like the endless abyss that surrounds us, it has no fixed shape, no starting point, and no edges. Limitless combinations are possible, and that's exactly the fun of it. ",

The Astronomical Rings use your position in relation to the sun to cast a ray of light through the device onto its timekeeping dials. When darkness falls, the Nocturlabe determines the hour and minute by aligning with stars found in the Big Dipper and Little Dipper.',
